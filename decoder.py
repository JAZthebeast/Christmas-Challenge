"""
Welcome to the Patrick Surry Christmas Challenge! Your goal is to create a function which decrypts the message 
below to uncover its secrets. Your function should return a morse code string that has '.' for dots and '-' for dashes, 
with ' ' between every character and ' / ' between every new word. An example string is as follows; 
'... --- ... / ... --- ...' This translates to 'SOS SOS'
Good luck!
